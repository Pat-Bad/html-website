          Verdena are an Italian rock band originating in Albino, Bergamo. As of
          February 2015, they have released six full-length albums under
          Universal Music Group. The members are Roberta, Luca, and Alberto
          (brothers).

          Alberto writes the lyrics of their songs, just the lyrics have often
          been criticized for the lack of external content, Alberto, however,
          stated several times to write solely to the melody and music, so that
          the words give only "color disk "without then tell stories or convey
          some meaning. The texts are not written but with the cut-up technique
          (as typified by the first album by the Italian band Afterhours). The
          composition of the texts are first singing in a fake British musical
          based on the track and then replace the English words with Italian
          words that sound good. The texts, as already mentioned, have no
          meaning or political narrative, but they are Alberto dream-like
          hallucinations. In another interview Alberto said: "They can in my
          opinion be interpreted differently, depending on the person, or at the
          time. [...] Everyone has his things differently and feel differently.
          My lyrics don't make sense, and at the same time have more than one.
          They also have three/four."
